I am a research associate in Chemistry at Northwestern University where I work primarily with [Todd Gingrich](https://gingrich.chem.northwestern.edu/). I completed my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Sheffield, advised by Prof. Eun-jin Kim. Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Massachusetts Boston working with [Jason Green](https://jasonrgreen.net/). I was also a visiting researcher at the Research Institute for Electronic Science, Molecular Life and Non-linear Sciences at Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan, working with Tamiki Komatsuzaki's group. My undergraduate and Masters was in Physics at Clarkson University, where I worked with Lawrence Schulman.

## Research Interests

I work in applied and computational mathematics. My most recent research interests are in developing and applying [tensor networks](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.041006) to classical stochastic processes in Biology and Chemistry. Previously I worked in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, developing bounds on transient far from equilibrium processes both [classical](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-020-0981-y) and [quantum](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.12.011038). At University of Massachusetts Boston I also worked in theoretical and computational combustion Chemistry. We utilized ideas from [information theory](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/148/4/044102/75400) and stochastic processes to understand the transient and fleeting sequences of chemical species that come about during combustion reactions.
